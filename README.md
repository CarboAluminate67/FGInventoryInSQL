# Overview

I wrote an updated version a previous project: making an inventory tracking system that handles quantities, ordering, selling, etc. In this instance I used SQL to handle the tabular data, and made this project to introduce myself to basic SQLite syntax. I used this as a way to learn SQL, and concepts such as databases, connections, queries, etc.

# Relational Database

I created a inventory database with a single items table to track items on hand with data such as quantity, type, price, etc. 

# Development Environment

I completed this project in VSCode in the python language, using the sqlite3 library. I used this to create a SQL database containing my table in order to handle the data.

# Future Work

- Error handling; Processing and accounting for user error in the text based UI
- Budget system; Including a way to track spending and available money in unison with the inventory
- Creating a better UI, perhaps even graphical, to allow easier interaction with the software.
